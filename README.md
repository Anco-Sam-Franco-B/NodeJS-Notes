## Introduction to Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to use JavaScript to build scalable server-side applications.

## Node.js Documentation
For comprehensive Node.js documentation, refer to the official [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/).

## Practical Assessment Materials
This section includes materials that can be used for practical assessments, such as exercises and coding challenges involving Node.js.

## CRUD Operations with MySQL
This section covers how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Node.js and MySQL. The basics of setting up a MySQL database and interacting with it through Node.js are also included.

### Setting Up MySQL
Make sure to have MySQL installed and configured on your machine. Create a database and table as required for your application.

### Example CRUD Operations
- **Create**: Use SQL `INSERT` statements to add records.
- **Read**: Use SQL `SELECT` statements to retrieve data.
- **Update**: Use SQL `UPDATE` statements to modify existing records.
- **Delete**: Use SQL `DELETE` statements to remove records.

Feel free to add your own notes and improvements to this README as you progress with Node.js and MySQL!
